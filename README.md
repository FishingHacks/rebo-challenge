# REBO Challenge
You need to get through a exploit for the index file the flag program executed. Executing flag on it's own is considered cheating. But i don't care if u do it, the challenge is for your satisfaction.

I am not going to do a writeup for this ._.

Please attempt it without looking in the source first, it will help you with reverse engineering and gives myself more satisfaction. :)

Linux only (are elf-64 binaries)
